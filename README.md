# Reminders
This is a web application in which the user can plan out their daily tasks and keep track of them. The user can create lists, such as "Groceries" and they can add as many lists as desired. For each list, the user can add as many tasks they have to complete. The user can edit each individual task and they can even clear any finished tasks. You can also delete any lists you no longer need.
