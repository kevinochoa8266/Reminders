# Reminders
This is a website in which you can plan out your tasks and keep track of them. You can create lists, such as "School" and you can add a new list will pop up. For each list, you can add as many tasks that you have to complete. After you finish a task you can mark it as finished and you can even clear any finished tasks. You can also delete any lists you no longer need. All the information is stored in the local storage so that everytime you open the webpage from your computer, your information will be stored. *Note: This webpage is the same that I have in the TaskList_Finalized repository but this one does not have a server and login system.
